# Video Conference Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the video conference implementation for the Collaboration Online Meet platform. The implementation uses a mock WebRTC service for demonstration purposes, with plans to integrate with a real WebRTC provider in the future.

## Components

### VideoConference Component

The main video conference component is located at `src/components/VideoConference/index.js`. It provides:

1. **Video Display**:
   - Main participant view
   - Local video preview
   - Grid layout for multiple participants

2. **Meeting Controls**:
   - Microphone toggle
   - Camera toggle
   - Screen sharing
   - Meeting settings
   - Leave meeting button

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Chat functionality
   - Participant list
   - Meeting information display

### VideoConferencePage Component

The wrapper component that handles routing and navigation is located at `src/components/VideoConference/VideoConferencePage.js`.

## Mock WebRTC Service

The mock WebRTC service (`MockWebRTCService`) simulates WebRTC functionality for development and testing purposes. It includes:

- Mock video stream generation using canvas
- Audio simulation
- Participant management
- Chat messaging
- Screen sharing simulation

## Integration Points

### Data Services
The video conference component integrates with the existing data services for:
- Meeting information retrieval
- Participant data
- Chat message persistence (planned)

### Routing
The video conference is accessible via the `/meeting/:meetingId` route.

## Future Enhancements

### WebRTC Provider Integration
Planned integrations with WebRTC providers:
1. **Daily.co** - Developer-friendly video API
2. **Twilio Video** - Enterprise-grade video communication
3. **Agora.io** - Real-time engagement platform

### Advanced Features
1. **Recording** - Meeting recording and storage
2. **Breakout Rooms** - Small group discussions
3. **Polls and Q&A** - Interactive meeting features
4. **Virtual Backgrounds** - Background replacement
5. **Live Transcription** - Real-time speech-to-text
