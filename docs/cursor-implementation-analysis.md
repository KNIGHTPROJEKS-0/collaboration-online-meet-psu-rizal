## What Cursor HAS NOT Implemented (Critical Missing Features)

### 1. Real WebRTC Integration ⚠️
- **Production WebRTC**: No integration with production WebRTC providers
- **Real Media Streaming**: Mock video streams instead of real camera feeds
- **Network Adaptation**: No adaptive bitrate or network optimization
- **Connection Quality**: No real connection quality monitoring

### 2. Advanced Meeting Features ⚠️
- **Recording**: No meeting recording capabilities
- **Breakout Rooms**: No small group functionality
- **Polling/Q&A**: No interactive meeting features
- **Virtual Backgrounds**: No video enhancement features
- **Live Transcription**: No speech-to-text functionality

### 3. Real-time Features ⚠️
- **WebSocket Connections**: No real-time data connections for actual video streaming
- **Live Participant Updates**: No real-time participant status updates
- **Live Chat**: No real-time messaging within meetings (UI only)
- **Meeting State Sync**: No synchronized meeting controls across participants

## Analysis of Orchestration vs. Implementation

### What Was Orchestrated But Not Fully Implemented
The project structure suggests that Cursor was intended to orchestrate a complete video conferencing solution, as evidenced by:
- Dedicated `VideoConference` component directory
- Integration with Webflow and Figma through MCP
- Browseract integration for automation tasks
- Complete UI for scheduling meetings

However, the actual implementation has progressed significantly but still lacks production-ready WebRTC capabilities.

### Current Implementation Status
1. **UI/UX**: 100% implemented - Complete interface with all planned components
2. **Data Layer**: 100% implemented - IndexedDB persistence with React Query
3. **Authentication**: 100% implemented - Firebase integration with protected routes
4. **WebRTC**: 30% implemented - Mock service with UI controls but no real streaming
5. **Real-time Features**: 20% implemented - UI only, no actual real-time connectivity
6. **Advanced Features**: 10% implemented - Basic UI elements but no functionality

### Gap Analysis
1. **UI vs. Functionality**: 100% of UI is implemented, 30% of core functionality
2. **Planned vs. Delivered**: The orchestration planned for a complete system, and a substantial portion has been delivered with a working UI
3. **Critical Path**: The missing WebRTC integration is still on the critical path for the application's purpose, but the foundation is much stronger than initially assessed

## Recommendations for Moving Forward

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Production WebRTC**:
   - Integrate with a WebRTC platform (Twilio, Agora, or Daily.co)
   - Replace mock WebRTC service with real implementation
   - Add real media streaming capabilities

2. **Enhance Real-time Features**:
   - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication
   - Add live participant updates
   - Enable real-time chat messaging

### Short-term Goals (4-6 weeks)
1. **Basic Video Conferencing**:
   - Multi-participant video streaming
   - Audio controls
   - Screen sharing
   - Chat functionality

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Recording capabilities
   - Participant management
   - Meeting analytics

### Long-term Vision
1. **Advanced Functionality**:
   - Breakout rooms
   - Polling and Q&A
   - Virtual backgrounds
   - Live transcription

2. **Platform Maturity**:
   - Mobile app development
   - Performance optimization
   - Security enhancements
   - Scalability improvements

## Conclusion

Cursor has successfully implemented a solid foundation for the Collaboration Online Meet platform, including all UI components, data layer, and authentication systems. The video conferencing functionality has a complete UI implementation with mock services, which provides an excellent starting point for integrating production WebRTC capabilities.

To make this a complete production solution, the next step should be implementing the actual WebRTC integration using a service provider, building on the excellent foundation that has already been established.
